# Data_analysis
It is the fundamental version of data analysis. It includes EDA and simple machine learning models.

**Basically, you can only click run to recieve a thorough report and simple model result of your data**

There are four parts of it.

## 0. Packages Used in the Program

Actually, this part only contains packages that will be repeatly used in the actions for EDA.

Some packages that will be merely used or used in models will be loaded in the functions or the part below. 

## 1. Reading and Processing Data

In this part, you can choose which way to read the data. The method of reading depends on the file type of your data.

After that, you will be asked to determine which variable(feature) you want to choose as the response variable(output).

Please remember to do that since not deciding the response variable will result in some errors in EDA part and all the model part.

## 2. Explotary Data Analysis

I will keep updating this part and try to explain all the functions and ways to interpret the charts.

## 3. Models

As you can see, most models are machine learning model except the DNN in the last albeit I always assume DNN as one of the machine learning model.

I also prepare some metrics to evaluate the performance. Maybe I will prepare a table of overview performance in the future update.
